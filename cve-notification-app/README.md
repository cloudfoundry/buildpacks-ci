# Buildpacks CVEs notification app

## Introduction
It is an application that monitors new CVEs that are announced for the dependencies that are being tracked.

It is an application that monitors new CVEs that are announced for the dependencies that you want to follow up.

It is built with:

* Golang.
* GithubActions as CI.
* [Memongo](https://github.com/tryvium-travels/memongo) for in-memory database testing.
* [Afero](https://github.com/spf13/afero), a filesystem framework.

This application will use
the [NVD Nist API](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/National-Vulnerability-Database/documents/web%20service%20documentation/Automation%20Support%20for%20CVE%20Retrieval.pdf)
to obtain the CVEs, performing a search using the CPE (Common Platform Enumeration) of each dependency.

## Core functionalities

#### Fill DB 
This application uses a database (MongoDB) in which the information of all the CVEs of the dependencies that
are known at the moment are stored. The ID, Vendor, Product, Severity, and Description are stored.

#### Find new CVEs
Through a scheduled [Cron (Every 2 hours)](../.github/workflows/cve-notification-find-new-cves.yml), it will search for new CVEs that are not in the database. If a
new CVE is found, it is notified via a slack Webhook in the [#buildpacks-cves-notifications](https://vmware.slack.com/archives/C02B2KWC2BE) channel with the following
format:

#### Update tracked dependencies
All the dependencies that this app will be monitoring will be stored in a CSV file called
`dependencies.csv`. This Workflow will run every time the file is modified, either a new dependency is added (to add the
new CVEs) or the file is deleted (to remove the CVEs from the database).


## Setup
This application requires 2 environment variables to be configured:

* **DB_URI**  : The MongoDB database connection URI.
* **SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL**  : Slack App webhook that points the corresponding channel.
