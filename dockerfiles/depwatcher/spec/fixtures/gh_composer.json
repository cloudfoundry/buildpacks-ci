    "body": "## Try it out now and get ready for the upcoming stable release\r\n\r\n- Use `composer self-update --preview` to try the latest alpha/prerelease version (2.x).\r\n- Use `composer self-update --snapshot` to try the latest dev build (2.x).\r\n- Use `composer self-update --stable` to go back to stable releases (1.x for now).\r\n- Use `composer self-update --1` in CI/scripts if you want to pin Composer to 1.x until you are ready to migrate, this will ensure you stay on 1.x releases even once a 2.0 stable comes out.\r\n\r\n## Changelog \r\n\r\n  * **Breaking:** This is a major release and while we tried to keep things compatible for most users, you might want to have a look at the [UPGRADE](UPGRADE-2.0.md) guides\r\n  * Many CPU and memory performance improvements\r\n  * The update command is now much more deterministic as it does not take the already installed packages into account\r\n  * Package installation now performs all network operations first before doing any changes on disk, to reduce the chances of ending up with a partially updated vendor dir\r\n  * Partial updates and require/remove are now much faster as they only load the metadata required for the updated packages\r\n  * Added a [platform-check step](doc/07-runtime.md#platform-check) when vendor/autoload.php gets initialized which checks the current PHP version/extensions match what is expected and fails hard otherwise. Can be disabled with the platform-check config option\r\n  * Added a [`Composer\\InstalledVersions`](doc/07-runtime.md#installed-versions) class which is autoloaded in every project and lets you check which packages/versions are present at runtime\r\n  * Added a `composer-runtime-api` virtual package which you can require (as e.g. `^2.0`) to ensure things like the InstalledVersions class above are present. It will effectively force people to use Composer 2.x to install your project\r\n  * Added support for parallel downloads of package metadata and zip files, this requires that the curl extension is present and we thus strongly recommend enabling curl\r\n  * Added much clearer dependency resolution error reporting for common error cases\r\n  * Added support for updating to a specific version with partial updates, as well as a [--with flag](doc/03-cli.md#update--u) to pass in temporary constraint overrides\r\n  * Added support for TTY mode on Linux/OSX/WSL so that script handlers now run in interactive mode\r\n  * Added `only`, `exclude` and `canonical` options to all repositories, see [repository priorities](https://getcomposer.org/repoprio) for details\r\n  * Added support for lib-zip platform package\r\n  * Added `pre-operations-exec` event to be fired before the packages get installed/upgraded/removed\r\n  * Added `pre-pool-create` event to be fired before the package pool for the dependency solver is created, which lets you modify the list of packages going in\r\n  * Added `post-file-download` event to be fired after package dist files are downloaded, which lets you do additional checks on the files\r\n  * Added --locked flag to `show` command to see the packages from the composer.lock file\r\n  * Added --unused flag to `remove` command to make sure any packages which are not needed anymore get removed\r\n  * Added --dry-run flag to `require` and `remove` commands\r\n  * Added --no-install flag to `update`, `require` and `remove` commands to disable the install step and only do the update step (composer.lock file update)\r\n  * Added --with-dependencies and --with-all-dependencies flag aliases to `require` and `remove` commands for consistency with `update`\r\n  * Added more info to `vendor/composer/installed.json`, a dev key stores whether dev requirements were installed, and every package now has an install-path key with its install location\r\n  * Added COMPOSER_DISABLE_NETWORK which if set makes Composer do its best to run offline. This can be useful when you have poor connectivity or to do benchmarking without network jitter\r\n  * Added --json and --merge flags to `config` command to allow editing complex `extra.*` values by using json as input\r\n  * Added confirmation prompt when running Composer as superuser in interactive mode\r\n  * Added --no-check-version to `validate` command to remove the warning in case the version is defined\r\n  * Added --ignore-platform-req (without s) to all commands supporting --ignore-platform-reqs, which accepts a package name so you can ignore only specific     platform requirements\r\n  * Added support for wildcards (`*`) in classmap autoloader paths\r\n  * Added support for configuring GitLab deploy tokens in addition to private tokens, see [gitlab-token](doc/06-config.md#gitlab-token)\r\n  * Added support for package version guessing for require and init command to take all platform packages into account, not just php version\r\n  * Fixed package ordering when autoloading and especially when loading plugins, to make sure dependencies are loaded before their dependents\r\n  * Fixed suggest output being very spammy, it now is only one line long and shows more rarely\r\n  * Fixed conflict rules like e.g. >=5 from matching dev-master, as it is not normalized to 9999999-dev internally anymore\r\n"
